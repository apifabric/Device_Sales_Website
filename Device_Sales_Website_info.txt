I recently started a new business focused on computer storage device sales.  I am selling devices such as Network Attached Storage (NAS) with Ethernet connectivity as well as Direct Attached Storage (DAS) providing USB 3.0 connectivity.  We will also sell internal and external accessories needed such as hard disk storage, eSATA devices like SSDs as well as M.2 PCIe & NVMe as well as USB-C and Cat-5 ethernet cables. Devices prociding 500GB storage all the way to devices providing 2 Terabytes of storage will be available.
